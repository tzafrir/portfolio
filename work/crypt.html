    <h2>What is Crypt?</h2>
    <p>This is a project in Game Design, Visual Design and Web Development. In collaboration with <a href="#" target="_blank">Robert Vinluan</a> and <a href="#" target="_blank">Peter Kim</a> as an independent study, the project began as an homage to one of my favorite games, <a href="#" target="_blank">Uplink</a> by Introversion Software. In Uplink, you are a hacker making your way to the top by hacking increasingly complex targets in a ridiculous Hollywood-style fashion. It&rsquo;s a classic game in every sense of the word&mdash;unique, nostalgic, replayable, and deeply outdated. Crypt was our attempt to both revamp the visuals and UX of the original game, and to turn in into a full-fledged online mass-multiplayer game.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>Our first step was replaying the original critically. We mapped out UX failures and wins and figured out what made the game fun. We then searched for was already out there. Many developers, enamored with Uplink, had created their own versions of the game. We went through every game we could find (about 8 in total) and took notes on what was and wasn&rsquo;t working.</p>
