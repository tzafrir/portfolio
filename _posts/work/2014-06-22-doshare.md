[Do Share](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/do-share/oglhhmnmdocfhmhlekfdecokagmbchnf?hl=en) was a collaborative project between myself and [Tzafrir Rehan](https://plus.google.com/+TzafrirRehan), who approached me with an idea for a Google+ post scheduling app in early 2012. He had been interning at Google and had worked on parts of the social network, which explains why he was using it in the first place. There was no official API at the time and there wouldn't be for a long time to come. This meant two things. First, we would have to employ a few workarounds and hacks that Tzafrir had in mind in order to make the app work. Second, the market would be wide open for a good while. Big apps such as Hootsuite would have to wait for a more established API before venturing into Google+ scheduling. We decided not to wait for them.

One of the limitations of the way we had to create the app was it couldn't post as the user without being logged in as the user. The only way to make a working app was for the user to have his browser open and logged in to Google+. With this in mind, Tzafrir opted for a Chrome extension. The extension would need to have its own interface, a button on the browser&rsquo;s toolbar, and inline buttons within Google+ modals and next to Google+ post buttons.

While Google+ posts didn&rsquo;t have titles, we decided that post titles within Do Share would be incredibly useful for users with many scheduled posts.
