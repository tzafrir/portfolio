[Do Share](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/do-share/oglhhmnmdocfhmhlekfdecokagmbchnf?hl=en) was a collaborative project between myself and [Tzafrir Rehan](https://plus.google.com/+TzafrirRehan), who approached me with an idea for a Google+ post scheduling app in early 2012. He had been interning at Google and had worked on parts of the social network, which explains why he was using it in the first place. There was no official API at the time and there wouldn't be for a long time to come. This meant two things. First, we would have to employ a few workarounds and hacks that Tzafrir had in mind in order to make the app work. Second, the market would be wide open for a good while. Big apps such as Hootsuite would have to wait for a more established API before venturing into Google+ scheduling. We decided not to wait for them.

One of the limitations of the way we had to create the app was it couldn't post as the user without being logged in as the user. The only way to make a working app was for the user to have his browser open and logged in to Google+. With this in mind, Tzafrir opted for a Chrome extension.

## Designing the App

Do Share was an exciting project for me, mostly because its scope allowed me to pursue to a certain extent an uncompromising user experience. It was just me and Tzafrir, a relatively small app, and no forseeable deadline (though we did set one ourselves). We had the time to experiment with new kinds of interfaces and interactions, and I took full advantage of that.

The project was straightforward. The extension would need to have its own interface, an indicator button on the browser&rsquo;s toolbar, and inline buttons within Google+ modals and next to Google+ post buttons. Users would need to be able to either post their content right away or schedule it for a later time, either from within Do Share or from the native Google+ interface. Most importantly, considering the project&rsquo;s inherent limitations (users needing to keep their browser open in order for it to work), the rest of the experience would have to be exceptionally simple and clear.

Right away I set us on the path to solve the most frustrating experience online text editors have to offer: user slips. Most text editors include an oversight when it comes to the back button and its effect on user content. That this issue is so prevalent is not surprising&mdash;keeping a user&rsquo;s text inputs in memory requires quite a bit of work behind the scenes, and in most places these small experiential details are never priorities. Here, though, we had a shot at solving this in a novel way, by 

I also pushed for Do Share to have post titles. While Google+ posts didn&rsquo;t have them, we decided that titles within Do Share would be incredibly useful for users with many scheduled posts, and for those who, well, just wanted titles. We kept the titles optional and when users chose to use them, Do Share would be prepended them to the post in bold. An interesting thing happened&mdash;most of our users started using them, and then people without the app began adopting the custom of first-line-as-title. Our small design choice inadvertently started a cultural phenomenon of post titles within Google+.

## Initial Sketches

A few days later I sent Tzafrir the initial sketches accompanied by this email.

    What do you think so far? Some explanations are in the rough paper sketch.<br><br>

    This isn't the final aesthetic, but after some deliberation I decided the app would be better off looking a lot like G+.<br>
    You want people to make an easy transition from there to doShare, and more importantly, keep the same mental models.<br>
    For instance, I moved the video/link/etc onto the wysiwyg bar for a while, but it wasn't obvious that you could only add one. <br>
    Keeping it the way google has designed it, whether it's perfect or not, lets us take advantage of what people already know.<br><br>

    This is no where near a final design either. I still have to add edit / delete buttons to posts, for instance.<br><br>

    Honestly, designing this now there's a lot of things we didn't think though.<br><br>

    Some things:
    <ul>
    <li>The app needs a search function, for people who need to go through many drafts.
    <li>Do you want to add the ability to delete posted posts? If not, displaying them is kind of pointless except as feedback that it worked.
    <li>What happens when you open a post? Same page or different page? If you open a scheduled item, can you save it as a draft? or is there some kind of unschedule button?
    <li>I think the best way to go about it is present the normal screen but instead of "save as draft", change the button title to "return to drafts" or maybe even "unschedule post" and have it just go to drafts.
    <li>What's the limit on the list of drafts? should it infinitely scroll or should you have a separate page for your drafts?
    <li>Do you need an option to disable comments
    </ul>

    <br>I'm probably forgetting something and we'll probably hit some more hitches down the line.
