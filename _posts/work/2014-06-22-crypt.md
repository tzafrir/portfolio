## What is Crypt?
Crypt is a project in Game Design, Visual Design and Web Development. In collaboration with <a href="#">Robert Vinluan</a> and <a href="#">Peter Kim</a> as an independent study, the project began as an homage to one of my favorite games, <a href="#">Uplink</a> by Introversion Software. In Uplink, you are a hacker making your way to the top by hacking increasingly complex targets in a ridiculous Hollywood-style fashion. It&rsquo;s a classic game in every sense of the word&mdash;unique, nostalgic, replayable, and deeply outdated. Crypt was our attempt to both revamp the visuals and UX of the original game, and to turn in into a full-fledged online mass-multiplayer game.

## Goals
The original game had out-dated visual design and frustrating interactions that were ill-suited for casual players. We intended to craft a sharp, contemporary visual design, create new, delightful interactions and interesting multiplayer gameplay. We narrowed our scope throughout the project and set to complete a playable prototype of Crypt&rsquo;s first mission.

## Research
Our first step was replaying the original critically. We mapped out UX failures and wins and figured out what made the game fun. We then searched for was already out there. Many developers, enamored with Uplink, had created their own versions of the game. We went through every game we could find (about 8 in total) and took notes on what was and wasn&rsquo;t working.

## Game Design
We started our process with a brainstorm that would last a month and fill half of the living room with post-its. Over time the game became more concrete. We scoped out what we wanted Crypt to be and began drawing up potential user flows. We also began thinking about how to structure our system, both in terms of code and in terms of ours players&rsquo; mental models.

Our initial ideas for Crypt&rsquo;s multiplayer aspect were especially ambitious, and an interesting excercise in game design. We wanted the player to always feel a sense of paranoia and impending doom. One of the ways we wanted to accomplish this was through what we called &ldquo;Indirect Multiplayer.&rdquo; The idea was that the player would interact with many other characters throughout the game, mainly by hacking them. Most of these would be NPCs (non-player characters) but some would be real people that could make human decisions about how to counteract an attack and the player would have no way of knowing. This turned out to be a rather novel concept, and I&rsquo;ve yet to see it in another game.
Once we narrowed the scope of the project, we focused on the first mission, which would adhere to the user flows we designed.
